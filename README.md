## About the project

The goal of this project was to code all the front-end of an e-commerce website.

We had to connect to an existing API, retrieve data and display it in the front-end.


## Features

- See the list of all products
- Add product to cart
- Delete product from cart
- Change quantity of a product in cart
- Form validation before confirming the order
- Confirmation page with a unique code provided by the API


## Tech Stack

- HTML
- Sass / Scss
- Javascript

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/bastien-pruvost/orinoco-project.git
```

2. Go to the project directory:

```bash
  cd orinoco-project
